## What is the problem?

![button](https://github.com/Choi-JaeHyeok-21500749/2579/blob/main/2570_pro.JPG)

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I tried to think it with greedy, but it was very complex.
After that I tried to think that saving the maximum value until now make sense.
So I write down the possible cases, and I notice that there is only 2 option before I step on to some stair.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is 21500749@handong.edu.
Thank you for visiting this github!
